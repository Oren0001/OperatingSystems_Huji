REMARKS:
None.

Assignment 1:
Initially, the program creates a new directory named "welcome_dir_1" with read, write and execute
permissions (777). Then it creates another directory in it named "welcome_dir_2" with the same
permissions.

Using the brk system call, the program changes the allocated space.
Using openat it creates and opens a new file named "welcome_file.txt" in directory "welcome_dir_2"
with read and write permissions (666), and it's file descriptor is 3. Then it opens another file
named "localtime" in read only mode, and it's file descriptor is 4.

Next, it uses fstat to get information about the file associated with file descriptor 4
("localtime"), such as size, mode, permissions, etc. Then it tries to read 4096 bytes from
the file, moves the current position using lseek, tries again to read 4096 from the file
and finally closes it.

Afterwards, the program uses fstat again to get information about the file associated with file
descriptor 3 ("welcome_file.txt"). Using the write function, it successfully writes
"welcome to OS-2023" to the file and closes it.

Finally, it deletes "welcome_file.txt" file using unlink and then it tries to delete
"welcome_dir_2" and "welcome_dir_1" using unlink again, but it fails with error code "EISDIR",
so it successfully deletes them using rmdir.
